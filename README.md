# NuclearClick

NuclearClick is a clicker game where you mine uranium and build up infrastructure to process it from ore to clean power.

## Inspirations

After seeing [fractalizes](https://github.com/fractalizes)'s clicker game [Gone Fishing](https://fractalizes.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1/), which used upgrade purchasing sound effects. I liked the increased feedback it gave to upgrading. A nice sound effect made purchasing upgrades much more satisfying. Since this is a core mechanic, it was a highly effective improvement.

[Inyoo403](https://github.com/inyoo403)'s beautiful [Planet Clicker](https://inyoo403.github.io/D1.a/) gave me so many ideas with which to improve the visual feedback and data organization of this project. I took inspiration from their division of clicker upgrades and passive upgrades and added back in a couple of buttons that allows the player to swap between the two categories.

Lastly, I enjoyed the custom cursor that [tatemaguire](https://github.com/tatemaguire) used in [Cheez-it Eating Simulator](https://tatemaguire.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1), and implemented a similar change.
